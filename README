# DigitalOcean User Setup Automation

This project automates the process of setting up a new user on a DigitalOcean droplet. By default, when creating a droplet, SSH access is only available as the root user. This project helps you automate the creation of a new user, adding them to the sudo group, and installing an SSH key for the user to access the server.

## Prerequisites

**Ansible**: You need to have Ansible installed on your local machine. You can install it via `pip` or through your system's package manager:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install ansible -y
   ```

##How It Works
This repository consists of three main files:

***create_inventory.yml**: Creates an inventory file for Ansible.
***playbook.yml**: Automates the user setup on the droplet (creating a user, adding them to the sudo group, setting up an SSH key, disabling root login, and restarting the SSH service).
***inventory.ini.j2**: A Jinja2 template for generating an Ansible inventory file.

##Setup
1. Create a vars.yml File
Before running the playbooks, you need to create a vars.yml file where you will define the required variables.
